        <p>Hello, my name is Gavin. I am 12 years old and this is my page of the website we're making at this AOL camp.</p>
        <p>I live in Dublin and I sometimes go to coder dojo in the SWICN computer clubhouse around the corner from where I live. The strange picture on the left is a logo I made for myself in art class. It is my initials, g and d.</p>

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        
        <p>My main project was called echo. I did it with my two friends Shane and Ben. It was to help blind people get around.They could "feel" when they were coming close to someone or something.</p>
        
        
        
    
        
        <div class="div2">
            
            <h3>How Echo worked</h3>
        
           <img src="images/Arduino.jpg" height="250px"/>
            

        <p>Echo used Ultrasonic sensors to tell how far away an object was and vibrated the closer you got. It was mounted on a wristband so you could point your hand a something and tell how far away it was. It was all controlled by a lilypad arduino (right).</p>
