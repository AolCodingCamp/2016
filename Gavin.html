        <p>Hello, my name is Gavin. I am 12 years old and this is my page of the website we're making at this AOL camp.</p>
        <p>My main project was called echo. I did it with my two friends Shane and Ben. It was to help blind people get around.They could "feel" when they were coming close to someone or something.</p>
        
        <h2>How it worked.</h2>
        
    </div>
        
        <div clas="div2">

        <p>Echo used Ultrasonic sensors to tell how far away an object was and vibrated the closer you got. It was mounted on a wristband so you could point your hand a something and tell how far away it was. It was all controlled by a lilypad arduino.</p>
