      <h3>It's called dragons den (not related to the show)</h3>
      <p>I made it with my freind petre.
     </p><p>It was going be cat and mouse but or mentore gave us the idea of changing it from a cat mouse and cheese so we desided to go with a knight dragons and gems.</p><p>  It had taken a long time trying to get the score to work and making other leveles and about one year the main game was made but we will continue updating the game in the futrue.</p><p> There are three levels a normal dungeon a cave and a lava level and there are three types of dragon's a normal ghost and zombie dragon's</p>

      <p>This song is important to me because it reminds me of 6 class when our teacher let us play music buring art and we would play this song and it would annoy him.<p>
